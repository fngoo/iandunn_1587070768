<h1>Error establishing a database connection</h1>
<p>This either means that the username and password information in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file is incorrect or we can&#8217;t contact the database server at <code>localhost</code>. This could mean your host&#8217;s database server is down.</p>

<li>Are you sure that you have typed the correct hostname?</li>
<li>Are you sure that the database server is running?</li>
